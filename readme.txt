One of our main concerns at TechGasp is to find solid ways for wordpress based websites to generate revenue. For that we already launched professional plugins like Google Ads Master or Amazon Master.

Groupon Master lets you integrate Groupon Deals inside your wordpress blog. It was never this easy to share and sell those deals with your users and visitors. Groupon Master automatically displays this ads and generates lot's of cash.

The plugin is totally customizable within the Groupon API, that means it fits perfectly into any of your template widget positions. With more than 15 ad sizes and side deals, it also packs groupon api accent color for the ads.

That's not all, you can even specify a city to show ads from or just have the cities in auto-detect according to the origin of your wordpress visitor.
